## Problem

### Background

URL shortening is a technique on the World Wide Web in which a URL may be made substantially shorter and still direct to the required page. (wikipedia)

For example, "https://noomii.com/post-request" can be shortened to "https://localhost:3000/abc".

### Description

This exercise involves building a very simple shorten URL App, from scratch like bit.ly.

Given an URL from an external website your App should be able to generate an unique shortened URL and if the user tries to access generated URL, the application should redirect to the original website.

Front-end should be very simple, just a input text and a button, when the user clicks the button, the page should show the shortened URL.

#### Requirements

- Do not use a gem to solve the main problem (shortening URL)
- Write tests with rspec for the models and controllers
